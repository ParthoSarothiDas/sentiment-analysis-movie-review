# 🎬 Sentiment Analysis of Movie Review

A simple and interactive web app built using **Streamlit** that classifies movie reviews as **positive** or **negative** using a pre-trained Logistic Regression model and TF-IDF vectorization.

## 🧠 How It Works

This app uses basic **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques such as:
- Lowercasing
- Tokenization
- Removing stopwords
- Stemming using `PorterStemmer`

The preprocessed text is then vectorized using **TF-IDF** and classified using a **Logistic Regression** model trained on a labeled dataset of movie reviews.

## 📊 Dataset

The model was trained using the [IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews), a popular dataset containing 25,000 positive and 25,000 negative labeled reviews. This dataset is widely used for binary sentiment classification tasks.
